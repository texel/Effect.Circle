Effect.Circle
=============
----------------

Effect.Move is fantastic, but have you ever wished you could animate your positioned elements in a circle? A semicircle? Any other permutation thereof? Well wish no more, **Effect.Circle** is here to bring all your dreams to vivid fruition.

Â¿But How?
---------
So glad you asked, but the upside-down question mark was kind of unnecessary. At any rate, you create an instance of Effect.Circle much the same as you would any effect:

    new Effect.Circle($('my_awesome_div'), {x: 5, y: 0, mode: 'relative', duration: 1.0, rotations: 1.0});
    
This would cause your awesome div to rotate once about a center point 5 pixels to the right of its current location. As you may have guessed, you can also pass in the "absolute" mode, which allows your center point to be defined in absolute terms. If you want your object to keep rotating over a longer period of time, you can specify a longer duration, and multiply your rotations accordingly:

    new Effect.Circle($('my_awesome_div'), {x: 5, y: 0, mode: 'relative', duration: 300, rotations: 300});
    
Naturally, you can slow down or speed up the effect by changing the relationship between duration and number of rotations.
